  **Design Movement**: Industrial Futurism / Cyber-Physical Systems
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Precision & Velocity**: Visuals should convey speed and accuracy through sharp lines and motion.
  2. **Data-Driven Transparency**: Use UI elements that mimic dashboards or data streams (subtly hinting at MDM capabilities).
  3. **Robust Reliability**: Strong, heavy structural elements to communicate trust in logistics.
  4. **Global Connectivity**: Visual motifs of networks, nodes, and paths.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Deep Navy & Electric Blue**: Represents corporate stability mixed with technological innovation.
  - **Signal Orange**: High-visibility accent color used in logistics safety, repurposed for CTAs to demand attention.
  - **Dark Mode Default**: To emphasize the "always-on" nature of logistics and technology, reducing eye strain for dispatchers/operators.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric Split-Screen**: Breaking away from the standard hero centered text. One side for heavy imagery/data viz, the other for clear, concise messaging.
  - **Modular/Card-Based Sections**: Content organized in "containers" or "pallets," reinforcing the logistics theme.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Tech-Overlay Graphics**: Subtle grid lines, crosshairs, or coordinate numbers overlaid on images.
  - **Progress Bars/Trackers**: Used as scroll indicators or section dividers.
  - **Glassmorphism**: Frosted glass effects on cards to layer information over complex backgrounds.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snappy & Mechanical**: Hover effects should feel instant and precise, like a switch being flipped.
  - **Parallax Scrolling**: To give a sense of depth and movement, simulating travel.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slide & Reveal**: Elements enter from sides, mimicking vehicles passing by.
  - **Data Ticking**: Numbers or stats that count up/scramble before settling.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Rajdhani* or *Chakra Petch* (Square, technical sans-serifs) for a futuristic, industrial look.
  - **Body**: *Roboto* or *Inter* for maximum legibility in data-dense areas.

  **Design Movement**: Swiss Style (International Typographic Style) Modernized
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Order & Clarity**: Absolute reliance on a grid system to organize complex logistics information.
  2. **Objective Photography**: Using the high-quality truck image as a factual, unadorned statement of capability.
  3. **Typography as Image**: Large, bold type that acts as the primary visual element.
  4. **Negative Space**: Extensive use of white space to suggest efficiency and lack of clutter/delay.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Monochrome + Red**: Black and white base to represent the binary nature of logistics (delivered/not delivered), with Swiss Red for urgent actions and branding.
  - **High Contrast**: Ensuring maximum readability on all devices.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Strict Grid**: Visible or invisible grid lines aligning every element.
  - **Typographic Hierarchy**: Size and weight dictate importance, no decorative boxes or shadows.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Big Bold Numbers**: Numbering sections (01, 02, 03) to imply a process or sequence.
  - **Horizontal Rules**: Thick lines separating sections, reminiscent of road markings or shipping manifests.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Minimal & Smooth**: Interactions are subtle shifts in color or position, no flashy effects.
  - **Cursor Effects**: A custom cursor that might change state over clickable elements.

  **Animation**:
  - **Kinetic Typography**: Text sliding into place or masking effects.
  - **Smooth Scroll**: A very controlled, perhaps slightly damped scroll experience.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Helvetica Now Display* or *Archivo Black* (Tight tracking, massive scale).
  - **Body**: *Inter* or *Roboto Mono* (for technical specs/details).

  **Design Movement**: Eco-Brutalism / Sustainable Logistics
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw & Honest**: Exposing the "structure" of the site, similar to exposed beams in a warehouse.
  2. **Sustainability Focus**: Visuals that imply green logistics and efficiency.
  3. **Utilitarian Aesthetics**: Function over form, but styled to look intentional.
  4. **High Accessibility**: High contrast and large touch targets.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Cardboard Beige & Asphalt Grey**: Natural, raw material colors.
  - **Neon Green**: For status indicators and "Go" signals.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Bento Box Grid**: Tightly packed blocks of content, fully responsive.
  - **Border-Heavy**: Thick black borders defining every region.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Marquee Text**: Scrolling text banners for announcements or keywords (e.g., "FAST • RELIABLE • GLOBAL").
  - **Sticker/Badge Graphics**: "Verified", "24/7", "Eco-Friendly" badges that look like shipping labels.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Tactile Feedback**: Buttons that depress visually (3D transform) when clicked.
  - **Hover States**: Inverting colors (black on white becomes white on black).

  **Animation**:
  - **Hard Cuts**: No fades, just instant state changes.
  - **Infinite Loops**: Marquees and rotating badges.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Space Grotesk* (Quirky, technical sans).
  - **Body**: *DM Sans* or *System UI*.
